REFLECTION:
This project was an excellent opportunity to learn full-stack web development 
with Flask and modern web technologies. I learned how to integrate OAuth 
authentication, work with external APIs, and create a responsive user interface. 
The most challenging part was integrating multiple news APIs and handling error 
cases gracefully. I reinforced my understanding of RESTful API design and 
gained experience with JSON data storage. The project helped me understand 
how social media applications work under the hood and the importance of 
user experience design.

FEEDBACK:
The coding challenge was well-structured and provided clear requirements. 
The scoring rubric helped prioritize features effectively. It would be helpful 
to have more guidance on API rate limits and error handling best practices. 
The workshops and office hours were valuable for getting started with the project.

BONUS FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
- Emoji reaction system beyond basic likes
- News aggregation from multiple sources with real-time updates
- Market data integration for financial news
- Responsive design that works well on mobile devices
- User profile pages with post history
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Keyboard shortcuts for better UX
- Auto-resizing textareas
- Share news articles as posts feature

DEPLOYMENT:
The application is designed to run on Render or any Flask-compatible hosting 
platform. 

This application demonstrates a complete social media platform with modern 
features while maintaining simplicity and ease of use.
